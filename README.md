# brown-dust-data-parsers

Python scripts used to parse Brave Nine JSON Data to Wikicode on https://bravenine.miraheze.org
* These previously parsed the XML Data files, but these have been deprecated in-game.

## Requirements

* Python 3+
* SkillBasicListText_ENG.txt (JSON Version)
* SkillTooltipDataBasicList.txt (JSON Version)

The latter `.txt` files can be obtained from the game data.

## Usage

Place the two `.txt` and the script in the same folder. Double-click script to run, which should output `effects-parsed.txt`.
